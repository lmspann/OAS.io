# API Documentation Sample

## About
Stripe is a company that has an API for credit card transactions. Many online companies use it as a way 
to charge their customers. Customers will enter credit card information at a company’s website, 
then the company’s servers will make calls to the Stripe API to make those transactions happen. 


Stripe's Tax Code API requests are used to obtain codes that determine a product’s tax rate.


I referenced [Stripe's API documentation] (https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_codes?lang=curl)
to create a sample OAS for the Tax Code API endpoints in 
[Swagger] (https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/techwritingportfolio-d6c/Stripe-API-Tax-Code-OAS/2025-10-29.clover).
